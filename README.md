# CUNet

Key Ideas:

I am trying to follow UNet architecture as exact as possible - it's all just matrix multiplication anyways

Trying to mimic pytorch's implementation for these defined functions, e.g avgpool2d and maxpool2d - Shoutout to them fr

To-do List:

Skip Connections
Loss Functions/Activation functions
Built total architecture 


Shoutout Timothy Cronin @4imothy (github) for giving me the idea to build UNet in C (Check out clear net)
